Let’s Do Some Laundry!

Problem Solving 101

Learning Objective: Begin learning to think like a software developer by shifting into a problem-solving mindset and adopting a process-oriented approach to solving problems.

Your Task:

1. Pretend you have never done laundry before, and never knew that laundry existed. In a paragraph, describe the problem that the process of doing laundry solves.

2. Now that you have named the problem, write another paragraph describing what this problem “solved” would look like.

3. Finally, in a numbered list, break down the process of doing laundry. Try to capture every single detail of doing laundry, as if you were doing it and narrating each step you took.

Do not worry about having the “right” answer or failing – this is an exercise in critical thinking!

More Practice:

Think of a situation you’ve come across in your own life, whether personally or professionally, where you have had to solve a problem.

Describe how you approached that problem at the time, and then apply the process above (name the problem, name what “solved” looks like, and detail a step-by-step process to reach the solution). For example, maybe your air conditioning unit went out or your car broke down, or you found yourself in a challenging leadership position. Write a few paragraphs about this!
